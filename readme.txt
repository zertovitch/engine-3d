Engine_3D is a real-time 3D engine project grabbed from my old data.
See feature list below for details.
The full texture rendering is in software: no OpenGL or the like!
And: Engine_3D is completely programmed in Ada.

Some parts of the 3D engine, like the animated bump mapping, are
still waiting to be ported to my newer 3D project, GLOBE_3D !...

DOS and Linux versions available.

Read E3D_Info.txt for more.

Features:
  * 6D vision - full camera movement (similar to Quake 1)
  * Dynamically lit texture rendering
  * Animated textures
  * Animated bump mapping with wave and heat simulation
  * Transparency
  * Portal rendering
  * Collision detection
